        "Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Rather than being explicitly programmed with rules, ML algorithms build models based on input data, improving their performance as they are exposed to more data.\n",
